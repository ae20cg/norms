# A Discovery on the Foundation of Norms

Norms are a key topic in machine learning. In this repo I aim to simplify and visualize some of these concepts in 2-D and 3-D geometry, although these conepts can be extended into much higher dimensions of course.

We can see that the angle between the x-axis and the vector of the intersection with the norm is increasing as the norm increases to infinity, where we have the components equal.
